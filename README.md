Anti-anti-horror roguelike

Made with rot.js

Horror is when monster eats you.

Ani-horror is when you are the monster that eats people.

Anti-anti-horror is when you are the monster that tries really hard to not eat people.

You control ...something... that has a split personality. One part hates people and kill them on sight. 
Other part is under you control - and it's your choice to follow your urges or fight them.

Controls: number keys to move

Goal: collect 4 ⚘flowers, then put them on the ☨grave. Avoid ☺ (or not).
