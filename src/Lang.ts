I had an opportunity to pass you this letter, I hope it will reach you. I will explain this 'opportunity' later.

I'm well, more or less, hope you are too. I have made some progress with my research, but not much. 
I have not yet found the cure, or even the cause of Strangling disease yet, but got some leads.
Locals have a different name for this disease - Forest Cough. And indeed, symptoms are much more prominent 
with those that are going to forest often. Which is the most of the village. They had very poor harvest last year, 
and a big chunk of it was looted. So, villagers have to look for food everywhere.
You would not find a living animal or unpicked edible berry or mushroom for a mile around the village by now.
`,`
I try to help them with what I can, but it's not much.
I performed surgery on occasion, used the medicine I brought from the city, some local herbs.
But villagers rarly ask me for help. They don't trust the "outsider" and I can't blame them. 
These days outsider is usually a thief or a rapist. People kill each other for a loaf of bread.
Fear, despair and hate are diseases that flood the land. Diseases that are way more fatal than Strangling.
And, unlike Strangling, they are definitely contagious. Sadly, ailness of spirirt are not my major. 
Let's hope I am at least qualified to cure the bodies at least.
`,`
I have even heard a rumors about cannibalism. Only rumors yet. 
At least I know for sure that locals bury their dead properly. I know it, because I wanted to do some autopsy.
But the Elder forbid me to even rise the question. 
And he is right, some people see me as a "witch" already, I don't want to add any more to my "spookiness".
I'm really afraid, you know. Life values so little here, mine included. Villagers tolerate me so far, but fear or desperation 
can push them over the edge any moment. And instead of as "weird woman in the forest hut" they'll see me as a witch that that spoils their crops. 
Or a food. I'd leave already, but travelling to capital is even more dangerous now than staying. And I still hope to find something about the disease.
`,`
Well, yes, about the "Forest Cough". Giving the leads I have, I naturally suspect that something in the forest causes the disease.
Though it's hard to find which "something". It can be animal, insect, maybe even plant? Or some microscopic organism. 
I keep searching, but only thing of note I have found so far is this kid that I send this letter with. 
He was lying on the outskirts of village, beaten half to death. 
Given that I have never seen him there before, he is probably some refugee or deserter that was either a victim of robbery, 
or a robber beaten by his would-be victims. Given that he would not want to talk about this, probably latter.
As you can guess, I patched him up and was hiding him for couple of weeks until he recovered. 
Then I figured it's a chance to pass you a letter. Hopefully he will not ditch it the moment he leaves my sight.
I said him you can give him some work, so please consider it. He seems to be bright enough. I have caught him once reading my medical notes, 
so he can read. I considered leaving with him, but I do not trust him enough yet.
