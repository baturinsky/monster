I had an opportunity to pass you this letter, I hope it will reach you. I will explain this 'opportunity' later.

I'm well, more or less, hope you are too. I have made some progress with my research, but not much. 
I have not yet found the cure, or even the cause of Strangling disease yet, but got some leads.
Locals have a different name for this disease: Forest Cough. And indeed, symptoms are much more prominent 
with those that are going to forest often. Which is the most of the village. They had very poor harvest last year, 
and a big chunk of it was looted. So, villagers have to look for food everywhere.
You would not find a living animal or unpicked edible berry or mushroom for a mile around the village by now.
`,`
I try to help them with what I can, but it's not much.
I perform surgery on occasion, used the medicine I brought from the city, some local herbs.
But villagers rarely ask me for help. They don't trust the "outsider" and I can't blame them. 
These days outsider is usually a thief or a rapist. People kill each other for a loaf of bread.
Fear, despair and hate are diseases that flood the land. Diseases that are way more fatal than Strangling.
And, unlike Strangling, they are definitely contagious. Sadly, ailness of spirirt are not my major. 
Let's hope I am at least qualified to cure the bodies.
`,`
I have even heard a rumors about cannibalism. Only rumors yet. 
At least I know for sure that locals bury their dead properly. I know it, because I wanted to do some autopsy.
But the Elder forbid me to even rise the question. 
And he is right, some people see me as a "witch" already, I don't want to add any more to my "spookiness".
I'm really afraid, you know. Life values so little here, mine included. Villagers tolerate me so far, but fear or desperation 
can push them over the edge any moment. And instead of as "weird woman in the forest hut" they'll see me as a witch that that spoils their crops. 
Or a food. I'd leave already, but travelling to capital is even more dangerous now than staying. And I still hope to find something about the disease.
`,`
Well, yes, about the "Forest Cough". Giving the leads I have, I naturally suspect that something in the forest causes the disease.
Though it's hard to find which "something". It can be animal, insect, maybe even plant? Or some microscopic organism. 
I keep looking for it, but nothing of note so far.
But I have found something else - this kid that I send this letter with. 
He was lying on the outskirts of village, beaten half to death. 
Given that I have never seen him there before, he is probably some refugee or deserter that was either a victim of robbery, 
or a robber beaten by his would-be victims. Given that he would not want to talk about this, probably latter.
As you can guess, I patched him up and was hiding him for couple of weeks until he recovered. 
Then I figured it's a chance to pass you a letter. Hopefully he will not ditch it the moment he leaves my sight.
I said him you can give him some work, so please consider it. He seems to be bright enough. I have caught him once reading my medical notes, 
so he can read. I considered leaving with him, but I do not trust him enough yet.

It's her! She smiles at me.

Oh, you have picked the flowers! How nice of you. I have a good news. 
Do you remember me dreaming of finding a way to cure evil in people? I have found it!
It's these very flowers fragrance. It works slow, but inhaling it for a long time will destroy the evil in people completely!
Would you please plant them around the village for me?

Of cause, she is not here. Who would survive after losing so much blood. Who killed her? Villagers? Looters? Does it matter?
She is not in this world anymore. All that remained of her is a huge, painful hole in my soul.
Why is it there? Why do I miss her so much? I have lived for many years without knowing of her existance, why do I need her so much now?
Or maybe, I always missed her, just did not know it. And because of that I was always in pain so big, I only could manage by throwing it at others.

Would explain a lot, wouldn't it?

Keep helping people, even though they can kill me for that? I'll never fill the hole you left in the world. Or the hole you have left in my heart.</div>

ending_depression:`
Of cause, she is not here. This blood must be hers. The stash with her books and research is all here. She would not leave without it.
Looks like her fears did materialise. 
<br/><br/>
Looking through her notes, I have found a theory about Strangling's cause. She thinks it's all these flowers I have collected. 
They cause an allergy that slowly, by steadily makes people's lungs unusable. 
Good thing is these flowers are quite picky about their environment. They grow only in dark dump places, and do not spread too much.
So it would not be difficult to weed them out around settlements. 
I'll show this to doctors in city. Maybe this time I will even find the one she has sent the letter to.

A mons... person that I have recognized as the village's Elder approaches me.

<div class="elder">
So, you are that kid with crazy eyes lurking in the forest I keep hearing about.
Are you looking for the healer woman? She is not living there anymore. 
Some brigand tried to rob her and slashed her with a knife when she cried out. We came to help, but she has lost a lot of blood.
My wife is looking after her at our house until she gets better.  I can take you to her.
</div>

I don't trust him. But.. Maybe it's true? Would make sense. Such a simple explanation. Probably I should have not assume she is dead so soon.
I came with the Elder and then...

It's her! Very pale, but alive. She smiles at me weakly. 

<div class="she">Ah... God! I turned out to be such a damsel in distress.</div>
